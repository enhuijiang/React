        I recently graduated from college with a degree in computer science.
        Through my educational experience. I’ve gained experience using
        programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and more.
        On my last internship, I’ve also refined my technical skills and
        problem-solving, teamwork and self-motivation. There, I designed and
        developed web pages using HTML where I use different animation effects
        and layout by using Content management System (with WordPress). Alone I
        Developed new functionalities and maintained front and back-end
        components by using java.
